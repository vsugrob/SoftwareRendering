# Software Rendering project #

This project was programmed purely for my own education:
I was studying 3d model rasterization algorithms
via triangle rasterization technique and ray-tracing.

### Triangle rasterization ###
Open SoftwareRendering.sln, set TextureFilteringDev.csproj as the StartUp project.

### Ray-tracing ###
Open SoftwareRendering.sln, set RayTrace.csproj as the StartUp project.
